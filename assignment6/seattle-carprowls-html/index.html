        <h2 style="margin-bottom:0px">Consistent Car Prowls Plague Seattle in Summer 2014</h2>
        <h4 style="margin-bottom:40px">By David Ells</h4>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; font-style:italic">
            Using data provided in a Coursera course on data visualization, 
            <a href="https://github.com/uwescience/datasci_course_materials/blob/master/assignment6/crimeanalytics.md">
                available here
            </a>, I've made some discoveries
            about a common crime in Seattle: "car prowls". It turns out that Car Prowls is not the name of a hockey team as you might expect, but
            rather the term refers to the crime of breaking into a vehicle and stealing it's contents, and it's a very persistent <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/police/prevention/auto/carprowl.htm">problem for Seattle</a>.

                <a href="https://github.com/davidells/datasci_course_materials/blob/answers/assignment6/seattle-carprowls.ipynb">this iPython notebook</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Car prowls are the most commonly reported crimes in Seattle during the summer of 2014</h3>
        <p>Why focus on carprowls? Because according to the data, it's the most common offense in Seattle by far, beating
           out the next closest offense, which is actually stealing the car itself. The chart below shows the number of occurrences
           reported according to the internal label the Seattle department uses to classify the crime.

        <h3>The problem is persistent over time</h3>
        <p>
            The following graphics show the number of carprowls reported each day during the summer of 2014. Though there is some day-to-day
            variance in the number of incidents reported, the overall level is consistent. The average number of daily incidents 
            is 29, with a standard deviation of 5 (this means that on average, 2 out of 3 days had somewhere between 24 and 34 incidents
            reported). The two week moving average shows a possible downward trend from June into the remainder of the summer, but otherwise
            the problem appears to be consistent.

        <h3>Afternoons and evenings show higher incident rates</h3>
        <p>
            If we look at reported incidents according to the hour of the day, we see a notable rise in incidents during the afternoon
            and evening hours. Note that this is the hour in which the crime is <i>reported</i>, which could differ from the hour in which
            the crime took place. This may explain the sudden drop-off of incidences after midnight: cars are being robbed while the owners
            are asleep. An alternative explanation for the dip is the assumption that these early morning hours are when there are simply
            less cars in public spaces.
